# 
# This problem deals with the one-player game foxes_and_hens. This 
# game is played with a deck of cards in which each card is labelled
# as a hen 'H', or a fox 'F'. 
# 
# A player will flip over a random card. If that card is a hen, it is
# added to the yard. If it is a fox, all of the hens currently in the
# yard are removed.
#
# Before drawing a card, the player has the choice of two actions, 
# 'gather' or 'wait'. If the player gathers, she collects all the hens
# in the yard and adds them to her score. The drawn card is discarded.
# If the player waits, she sees the next card. 
#
# Your job is to define two functions. The first is do(action, state), 
# where action is either 'gather' or 'wait' and state is a tuple of 
# (score, yard, cards). This function should return a new state with 
# one less card and the yard and score properly updated.
#
# The second function you define, strategy(state), should return an 
# action based on the state. This strategy should average at least 
# 1.5 more points than the take5 strategy.
