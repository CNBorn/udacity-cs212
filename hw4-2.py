# -----------------
# User Instructions
# 
# In this problem, you will solve the pouring problem for an arbitrary
# number of glasses. Write a function, more_pour_problem, that takes 
# as input capacities, goal, and (optionally) start. This function should 
# return a path of states and actions.
#
# Capacities is a tuple of numbers, where each number represents the 
# volume of a glass. 
#
# Goal is the desired volume and start is a tuple of the starting levels
# in each glass. Start defaults to None (all glasses empty).
#
# The returned path should look like [state, action, state, action, ... ]
# where state is a tuple of volumes and action is one of ('fill', i), 
# ('empty', i), ('pour', i, j) where i and j are indices indicating the 
# glass number.

    """The first argument is a tuple of capacities (numbers) of glasses; the
    goal is a number which we must achieve in some glass.  start is a tuple
    of starting levels for each glass; if None, that means 0 for all.
    Start at start state and follow successors until we reach the goal.
    Keep track of frontier and previously explored; fail when no frontier.
    On success return a path: a [state, action, state2, ...] list, where an
    action is one of ('fill', i), ('empty', i), ('pour', i, j), where
    i and j are indices indicating the glass number."""
