# Write two functions, path_states and path_actions. Each of these
# functions should take a path as input. Remember that a path is a 
# list of [state, action, state, action, ... ]
# 
# path_states should return a list of the states. in a path, and 
# path_actions should return a list of the actions.

def path_states(path):

def path_actions(path):
    "Return a list of actions in this path."
    return [node for node in path if node[2] in ['->','<-']]
