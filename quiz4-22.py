# User Instructions
# 
# Write a function, csuccessors, that takes a state (as defined below) 
# as input and returns a dictionary of {state:action} pairs. 
#
# A state is a tuple with six entries: (M1, C1, B1, M2, C2, B2), where 
# M1 means 'number of missionaries on the left side.'
#
# An action is one of the following ten strings: 
#
# 'MM->', 'MC->', 'CC->', 'M->', 'C->', '<-MM', '<-MC', '<-M', '<-C'
# where 'MM->' means two missionaries travel to the right side.
# 
# We should generate successor states that include more cannibals than
# missionaries, but such a state should generate no successors.

def csuccessors(state):
    """Find successors (including those that result in dining) to this
    state. But a state where the cannibals can dine has no successors."""
    M1, C1, B1, M2, C2, B2 = state
    # your code here
