# Write a function, shortest_path_search, that generalizes the search algorithm
# that we have been using. This function should have three inputs, a start state,
# a successors function, and an is_goal function.
#
# You can use the solution to mc_problem as a template for constructing your 
# shortest_path_search. You can also see the example is_goal and successors
# functions for a simple test problem below.

# From a state, i, the only possible successors are i+1 and i-1. Given
# a starting integer, find the shortest path to the integer 8. 
#
# This is an overly simple example of when we can use the 
# shortest_path_search function. We just need to define the appropriate
# is_goal and successors functions.
